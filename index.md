# Video Player using C++ by Adrià Sellarés Salvador

Welcome! This is a small project created by a Videogame Development and Design student. I'll show you how I managed to create a Video Player using Visual Studio 2019 and C++. Notice this project may possibly not work on another OS. If you want to try running the code on iOS, keep in mind you may need to make some changes. Even so, the libraries used in this project are cross platform, so the code can be very likely transformed to work using the same libraries.

In the GitHub repository you'll find two folders, one containing an exercice and the other the solution to that exercice. If you are interested on checking the Github respoitory click [here](https://github.com/AdriaSeSa/VideoPlayerCpp).









## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AdriaSeSa/VideoPlayerCpp/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AdriaSeSa/VideoPlayerCpp/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
